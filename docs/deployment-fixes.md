# Deployment Issue Resolution Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix deployment issues with our ECS infrastructure.

## Issues and Resolutions

### 1. ECR Authentication Problem

**Issue:** Docker image push to ECR was failing with "no basic auth credentials" error.

**Resolution:**
- Updated the CI/CD workflow to use the `aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2` action
- Set the `ECR_REGISTRY` environment variable from the login action output
- Removed hardcoded ECR registry URL that was using an invalid AWS account ID

### 2. Health Check Failures

**Issue:** ECS health checks were failing because the `/api/health` endpoint required authentication.

**Resolution:**
- Updated the authentication middleware to exempt both `/health` and `/api/health` paths
- Ensured the health check path in the task definition matches the exempt paths
- Improved the health check script in the CI/CD workflow to use correct bash syntax

### 3. GitHub Secrets Configuration

**Issue:** GitHub Actions workflow was showing "Context access might be invalid" warnings for secrets.

**Resolution:**
- Created documentation explaining how to set up required GitHub secrets
- Ensured the workflow references only the necessary secrets
- Removed AWS account ID from environment variables to use ECR login output instead

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

**Issue:** Lack of clear documentation for the CI/CD process.

**Resolution:**
- Created comprehensive documentation explaining the CI/CD pipeline
- Added troubleshooting information for common issues
- Documented the required secrets and their purposes

## Key Changes Made

1. **Authentication Middleware (`api/src/middleware/auth.js`)**:
   - Added `/api/health` to exempt paths list

2. **CI/CD Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)**:
   - Updated ECR login process using `aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2`
   - Fixed environment variable setting for ECR registry
   - Improved health check script to use correct bash syntax
   - Added proper error handling and logging

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created `docs/github-secrets-setup.md` for secrets configuration
   - Created `docs/cicd-pipeline.md` for CI/CD pipeline documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   - Add the required secrets to the GitHub repository settings
   - Ensure AWS IAM user has the necessary permissions

2. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Merge changes to the main branch to trigger a deployment
   - Monitor the CI/CD pipeline for successful execution
   - Verify the health check passes after deployment

3. **Test Authentication**:
   - Verify the login endpoint works with the provided credentials
   - Test that authenticated endpoints require a valid token
   - Confirm that health check endpoints are accessible without authentication

## Conclusion

The changes made address the key issues that were preventing successful deployment. By fixing the ECR authentication, health check configuration, and providing proper documentation, we've established a more robust deployment process that should work reliably for future updates.
